## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow
- Media Queries to transition to other screen sizes

### What I learned

I understood how to use a wireframe and start development from there. I used semantic markup to the HTML which helped me structure my content properly.

### Continued development

This project didn't require flexbox or CSS grid. I look forward to using it for other challenges

### Useful resources

- [CSS BEM Naming Convention](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) - This helped me for use proper class names for the HTML elements. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
